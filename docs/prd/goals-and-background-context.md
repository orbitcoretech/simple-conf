# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable users to discover internal documentation through natural language queries, reducing search time by 50%
- Achieve 80% weekly active usage across all target departments within 2 months of launch
- Provide cross-departmental knowledge accessibility where Sales docs become discoverable by developers through plain English questions
- Deliver 70%+ query success rate where users find relevant documents on their first attempt
- Establish a living knowledge base with visible engagement signals (view counts, comments, active maintenance)

## Background Context

Internal documentation across the organization is currently siloed by department, making discovery friction-heavy and dependent on knowing exact folder structures or document names. Teams waste significant time searching for or recreating documentation that already exists, while new hires face steep onboarding curves without clear paths to institutional knowledge.

SimpleConf addresses this by prioritizing **discoverability over features** — a natural language query bar as the primary interface, a clean folder hierarchy with visual access indicators, and minimal collaboration features to keep documentation alive without complexity creep. Unlike Confluence or Notion which are powerful but overwhelming, SimpleConf is deliberately scoped for the specific needs of a tech organization with cross-functional teams.
